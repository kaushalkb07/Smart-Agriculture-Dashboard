# Smart Agriculture Dashboard

### Overview
The **Smart Agriculture Dashboard** is a web-based platform designed to help farmers and agricultural managers monitor and manage environmental conditions in real-time. The dashboard uses simulated sensor data to provide insights into factors like soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, enabling data-driven decisions that optimize farming activities.

By leveraging the latest technologies in data visualization and analytics, the system aims to improve agricultural efficiency, resource management, and crop yield, while reducing environmental impact.

## Features

### 1. Real-Time Environmental Monitoring
- Monitor simulated environmental factors such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity in real time.
- Track changes across multiple farm locations or plots.

### 2. Data Visualization
- Visualize real-time and historical data through interactive charts and graphs.
- Display trends over time for better understanding of environmental conditions.

### 3. Crop Growth Prediction
- Simulate crop growth patterns based on environmental data.
- Provide recommendations on irrigation, planting, and harvesting based on current conditions.

### 4. Weather Data Integration
- Integrate real-world weather data using APIs (e.g., OpenWeatherMap) to simulate how rainfall and temperature affect the farm.
- Use weather predictions to optimize farm activities like irrigation and harvesting.

### 5. Alerts and Notifications
- Get notified when certain conditions exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., low soil moisture, extreme temperature).
- Alerts can be viewed via the dashboard or sent through email notifications.

### 6. Resource Management
- Monitor and track water usage for irrigation based on soil moisture levels.
- Generate reports to improve water and energy efficiency on the farm.

### 7. User Roles
- **Admin:** Manage all farm plots, add users, and monitor multiple farms.
- **User:** View and manage assigned farm plots and access environmental data and reports.

## Simulated Data

This project uses simulated sensor data for environmental conditions such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity. You can modify the simulation script to generate different data patterns or integrate with APIs for real-time weather information.

## Future Enhancements

- **Hardware Integration**: Replace simulated data with actual IoT sensors for real-world monitoring.
- **Advanced Data Analytics**: Implement machine learning models to predict crop yields and resource requirements.
- **Mobile App**: Build a mobile interface for farmers to access the dashboard on the go.
